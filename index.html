      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <div class="first-inner-about">

        <p>Hello! My name is Donit Gashi.<br /> I come from a beautiful and newly independent country located in the South Western part of Europe called Kosovo. I am currently living and studying in Germany. I study Computer Science at International
          University (IU) in Bad Honnef. I am also employed full-time as a Graphic Designer from 2019.<nr>

            </br> I have been facinated about computers and technology from the moment I got my first computer and gaming console. Some of my interests are software development and design, web and application development, artifical intelligence,
            machine learning and robotics. Further, I am also eager to learn new programming languages and skills needed to create and design websites. My job experience has helped me further develop my skills and enrich my creativity. As a Graphic
            Designer, I am passionate about helping businesses and individuals develop their brand and use graphics to communicate with their audience.
            <br />In the future, I would like to develop applications and websites that will make life easier for people.

        <h1>My Passion</h1>
        <p>My passion is Photography. I started taking pictures when I was barely an adult. I was always fascinated by the way buildings and architecture looked from afar. I loved to explore different parts of the city and take pictures of the beauty
          that lay beneath the surface. While doing this, I found that my photos really captured the spirit of the city and its people.</p>
